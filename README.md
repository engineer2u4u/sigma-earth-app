# sigma-earth-app
Objective: Create a mobile app (for iOS and Android) by converting my WordPress website, https://sigmaearth.com/, into a native or hybrid app with seamless navigation and functionality.

**Website Details:**

Main URL: https://sigmaearth.com/
Key Sections to Include:
Environmental Courses: https://sigmaearth.com/environmental-courses/
Jobs: https://sigmaearth.com/sustainability-jobs/
Eco Listing: https://sigmaearth.com/eco-friendly-sustainable-products-services/
Events: https://sigmaearth.com/environmental-courses/events/



**App Requirements:**

Navigation Structure:
Implement a bottom navigation bar with tabs OR homepage buttons (choose the option that best suits mobile UX) for the following sections:
Home (https://sigmaearth.com/)
Environmental Courses (https://sigmaearth.com/environmental-courses/)
Jobs (https://sigmaearth.com/sustainability-jobs/)
Eco Listing (https://sigmaearth.com/eco-friendly-sustainable-products-services/)
Events (https://sigmaearth.com/environmental-courses/events/)


Ensure each section is directly accessible and loads the corresponding webpage content within the app.


**Design:**
Mirror the website’s branding (colors, logo, fonts) from https://sigmaearth.com/.
Use a clean, modern UI optimized for mobile devices.


**Features:**
Enable push notifications for updates on new courses, jobs, eco listings, or events.
Support offline access to cached content for the above sections.
Include a search function to browse courses, jobs, and eco listings.
Ensure compatibility with WordPress plugins (e.g., for job listings or course enrollment).


**Functionality:**
Sync app content in real-time with the WordPress site using REST APIs.
Allow users to interact with forms (e.g., job applications, course registrations) within the app.
Optimize for both iOS and Android with smooth performance.


**Publishing:**
Prepare the app for submission to Google Play and Apple App Store.
Provide a preview mode for testing before publishing.



**Additional Notes:**

Prioritize user-friendly navigation, ensuring the four key sections (Courses, Jobs, Eco Listing, Events) are prominent.
If tabs are used, ensure they are labeled clearly (e.g., “Home,” “Courses,” “Jobs,” “Eco Listing,” “Events”).
If homepage buttons are used, place them prominently on the app’s home screen with icons reflecting their purpose (e.g., a book for Courses, a briefcase for Jobs).
Maintain responsiveness for all screen sizes (phones and tablets).

**Output:**

Generate a fully functional mobile app with the above specifications.
Provide source code (if applicable) and app store submission guidance.
Deliver a preview link or QR code for testing the app.
